// Orbit Core :: runtime resolution (Update 4.0.4).
//
// The ONE place that answers "which Swiss Ephemeris executable should this
// process use, and is it actually usable?". Before 4.0.4 the answer was a
// single hardcoded path to a macOS arm64 binary, which is why every astrology
// feature would have failed on Vercel's Linux x64 functions.
//
// Nothing above this module knows that an executable exists at all. Chart,
// transit, Current Sky, fortune, and Ask Orbit evidence all reach the ephemeris
// through lib/astro/ephemeris.js, which resolves through here — so there is no
// second code path that could pick a different binary.
//
// Rules this module enforces:
//   - the runtime is chosen from process.platform + process.arch, never guessed
//   - an unsupported platform fails with a structured error, it does NOT fall
//     back to a binary built for another operating system
//   - every path is resolved relative to this module, never the process cwd
//   - nothing is ever downloaded, at startup or during a request
