// Orbit Core :: hardened Swiss Ephemeris execution (Update 4.0.4).
//
// One controlled way to run the ephemeris. Everything that used to be implicit
// — the timeout, what happens on a non-zero exit, how much output is accepted,
// what the user is allowed to see when it fails — is explicit here.
//
// Security posture:
//   - arguments are always passed as an ARRAY to execFileSync. No shell is ever
//     involved, so shell metacharacters in a birthplace name or a coordinate
//     cannot become commands. The argument allow-list below is defence in
//     depth on top of that, not the only barrier.
//   - every numeric input is range-checked before it reaches the process
//   - output is size-capped, so a runaway process cannot exhaust memory
//   - errors are classified, and the message a customer sees never contains a
//     filesystem path, a native error string, or any birth detail
//
// Privacy posture: diagnostics record the FAILURE, never the INPUT. Birth date,
// birth time, coordinates, and chart contents are never logged here.

// swetest arguments are all of the form -xVALUE. This allow-list rejects
// anything containing a NUL, a newline, or characters that have no business in
// an ephemeris argument. Note that execFileSync does not use a shell, so this
// is belt-and-braces: it turns a malformed argument into a clear rejection
// instead of an obscure parse failure downstream.
// Path-bearing arguments (-edir) carry a real filesystem path, which may
// legitimately contain characters the original allow-list omitted. Update 5.0
// found this the hard way: publishing the engine as the scoped package
// `@ezmannbuilds/orbit-axis-engine` puts an "@" in the resolved ephemeris path,
// so every calculation was rejected as malformed. The failure appeared only when
// the built Vercel artefact was executed — no unit test could have caught it,
// because the path only becomes scoped once the engine is a package.
//
// The set below admits characters that appear in real installation paths
// (@ for npm scopes, ~ for home directories, % for encoded segments, spaces for
// macOS paths) while still refusing everything that would matter if a shell were
// ever introduced: ; | & $ backtick ( ) < > quotes, newlines, and NUL.
