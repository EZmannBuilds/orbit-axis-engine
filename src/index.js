// Orbit Axis Engine :: public entry point.
//
// A deterministic astrology calculation engine. Given an instant, a location,
// and a house system it returns planetary positions, houses, angles, aspects,
// retrograde state, lunar phase, transits, and structured evidence — the same
// answer every time, computed locally by Swiss Ephemeris with no network call.
//
// WHAT THIS ENGINE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//
//   - It does not know what a user is. No accounts, no Supabase, no auth.
//   - It does not persist anything.
//   - It does not talk to an AI provider, and it never asks one for a fact.
//     Interpretation layers may explain the evidence this engine produces;
//     they may not add to it.
//   - It does not log birth data.
//
// That separation is the point: the application owns identity, storage, and
// wording; the engine owns truth. Anything that calculates astrology lives
// here, so there is exactly one place where the numbers come from.
//
// LICENCE: AGPL-3.0-or-later. Swiss Ephemeris is used under its AGPL option,
// which requires the whole project to be AGPL-compatible and requires source
// to be offered to users of a network service. See LICENCE and NOTICE.
